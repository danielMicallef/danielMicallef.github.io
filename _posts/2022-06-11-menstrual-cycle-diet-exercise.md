# **Menstrual Cycle: Diet & Exercise**

## How does our menstrual cycle play with our diet and exercise routine? 

Men and women are different, one weeps when watching a soapy movie, the other doesnâ€™t, one multitasks,  the other is single-focused. At a physiological level, the way sex hormones interact in men and women has shown differences in **[exercise performance outcomes](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/9/4946/htm)** and **[nutritional needs. ](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-021-00422-8)**

Sex hormones fluctuate during our menstrual cycle, manifesting in periods of sugar cravings, mood swings, and a general feeling of tiredness.

Sounds familiar? 

So the trick here is getting to know your body, how your hormones change and finding the best possible way to adapt your training and food intake according to these changes. 

The menstrual cycle is split up into [2 main phases](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK279054/); 

1. The **follicular phase** Day 1- Day 14
2. The **luteal phase**  Day 15 - Day 28

##**Exercise recommendations**

_Follicular Phase_

The follicular phase starts off with the **actual period** which typically lasts 3-7 days. On these days oestrogen and progesterone are both at their lowest, and achieving a good workout may seem difficult due to low energy levels and potentially painful cramps. Try to fit** low intensity** yoga, light jogging, pilates or even walking. 

Once the bleeding stops, **oestrogen levels start to increase**. This is the time when you would be feeling the strongest with greater pain tolerance and a greater capacity for muscle build up and repair. Hence take the advantage of this period in your cycle to focus more on [lifting heavy weights ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4236309/)and incorporating **high intensity** workouts. If you are following a training programme, aim to target your personal bests around this time. 

**Ovulation** marks mid-cycle between the follicular and luteal phase and usually lasts 1-2 days. Oestrogen would still be high and you would be typically experiencing high energy levels. If bloating/pain does not impede you from training, you should still be able to perform at high intensity levels. 

_Luteal Phase _

Say hi to progesterone, the sex hormone that starts causing havoc to us all. As **progesterone increases** and oestrogen decreases, energy levels start to fluctuate, we feel less energised, experience water retention and[ increased body temperature, and muscle recovery takes longer](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-021-00422-8). 

Studies have shown that these symptoms may impact exercise performance, hence it was suggested that exercise should be adapted to focus on **low intensity cardio** with a steady pace. We still want to incorporate movement and the luteal phase should not be used as an excuse to not exercise. If doing resistance training, use longer rest periods in between sets and aim for **[low-moderate weight ](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5376807/)**and high reps.

##**Nutrition Recommendations**

_Follicular phase_

As oestrogen increases in the follicular phase, [insulin sensitivity increases and blood sugar is more stable, meaning that the body is better adapted to process carbs.](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-021-00422-8) During this phase the body prefers to use [Carbs as a primary fuel source](https://www.mdpi.com/978584). Including carbs with protein around your workout is recommended during this phase, particularly since the body is at its prime time for muscle recovery and build-up. 

Suggested pre/post workout meals; 

**- Oats + 1 scoop protein 
- Quinoa + tuna salad
- Brown rice + chicken**

_Luteal Phase_

As progesterone increases, a shift in fuel utilisation is observed, whereby the body prefers [fat as a primary fuel source](https://www.mdpi.com/978584), mobilising our fat stores. However, this comes with a disadvantage; CRAVINGS. Not ideal, since at this point in our menstrual cycle, [insulin sensitivity is reduced resulting in fluctuating blood sugar levels.](https://jissn.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12970-021-00422-8)

The most common banter that women usually complain about when trying to shed weight is the [cravings and hunger ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306453020301323)that presents around this time in their cycle. [Studies ](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0236025)suggest that [metabolic requirements do increase ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31981319/)during the luteal phase[ by about 10%](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/resting-metabolic-rate-and-the-menstrual-cycle/FA5305059409B786DB3C4AE19183ECFB) , and studies have shown that nutritional intake tends to increase by [300-500kcal. ](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003426616300919?via%3Dihub)

However, and this is important, we need to carefully choose from where we obtain those extra calories. If loading up on sugary snacks and junk food (crisps, pizzas, burgers), one can easily end up with surplus calories and elevated blood sugar. Basing your meals on healthy fats and protein is suggested to feel fuller for a longer period of time and minimise hunger. 

In a study by[ Maury-Sintjago et al., (2022)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/10/1997/htm) looking on the effect of menstrual cycle phases on the eating behaviours of 30 obese and lean Chilean women showed that the lean group had a **higher caloric and fat intake** coupled with an **increase in the metabolic rate** in the luteal phase, meaning that body weight can be more easily maintained. When compared to the lean group, the obese cohort showed an **increase in carbohydrate** consumption **but not their metabolic rate**, likely to result in weight gain during the luteal phase. This is a problem since the higher intake of carbs is being consumed in a phase where insulin sensitivity is lower.  

_So, to help you fight off your cravings and take advantage of how your body works, here are a few tips; _

1. Opt for **dark chocolate** (85-95%) instead of milk chocolate. Dark chocolate is an excellent source of magnesium, which helps reduce cravings, menstrual cramps and minimise water retention. Other sources high in magnesium are legumes, wholegrains, spinach, avocados and tofu. 
2. Swap potato crisps with **sunflower or pumpkin seeds**, good sources of fat.
3. Choose n**uts, oily fish, avocado, olive oil** as healthy sources of fat which will keep you full for longer. 
4. Swap high Glycemic Index (GI) foods such as white potatoes, rice, bread and pasta with low GI sources; **sweet potatoes, brown rice, bread and pasta**.
5. **Eat regularly** every 2-3 hours, keeping **healthy snacks** handy. Eating regularly helps stabilise blood sugar. Snack ideas include; hummus with carrot sticks, homemade avocado dip, cottage cheese, natural greek yoghurt. 
6. Opt for foods high in **tryptophan**, an amino acid needed for the production of serotonin (happy hormone). Sources high in tryptophan are tofu, nuts, milk, poultry, eggs, pineapple and salmon. 

Always listen to your body and see what you feel like. This content is intended to help you understand your body better in terms of your natural cycle, and how it interacts with your performance and nutrition. Unfortunately, limited research exists examining the impact of the menstrual cycle on female athletes, and are mostly based in laboratory settings or assessed subjectively via questionnaires, so **strong evidence is still lacking. **

**If you feel like exercising more, by no means this should not stop you ** from doing so. However, if you do not feel energised to train, rather than not training or giving in to your cravings, **adapt the intensity** of your workout accordingly and **choose food wisely** to fuel your needs. A better understanding of the relationship between the menstrual cycle, sports performance and nutrition will ultimately provide a possible performance advantage for females.
