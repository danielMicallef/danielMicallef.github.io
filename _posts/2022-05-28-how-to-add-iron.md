Do you experience periods of generalised tiredness and shortness of breath? You may be suffering from Anaemia - a condition that generally results from **iron deficiency** in the blood. 

Iron is a mineral needed to produce **haemoglobin**. Haemoglobin is a protein present in red blood cells to help **transport oxygen** around the body. A deficiency of iron may lead to a lack of oxygen in the blood resulting in a lack of energy and increased risk of infections, and in severe deficiencies, thinning of hair, brittle nails, heart palpitations, itchy skin and mouth ulcers. 

Anaemia mostly affects **infants, adolescents, pregnant ladies and women that are menstruating**. Research has shown that [iron supplementation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30068354/) can also aid [sports performance](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cophys.2019.05.009) particularly when training for **altitude running**. Due to the lack of oxygen at higher altitudes, having an iron deficiency would impact the athleteâ€™s performance because the body would not be able to transport oxygen efficiently to cells.

Although iron supplementation in tablet form may be essential if the client is already in a deficiency, iron intake can be achieved through diet. Dietary iron can be obtained from both **plant-based** and/or **animal-based** foods.

The following is a list of foods that are high in iron;
1. Seafood
2. Red meat  
3. Chicken 
4. Canned tuna (usually fortified with iron)
5. Beef/ chicken liver
6. Fortified cereals
7. Fortified bread/ rice
8. Millet
9. Quinoa
10. Beans
11. Dark chocolate
12. Lentils 
13. Spinach
14. Potatoes with skin 
15. Nuts
16. Oats
17. Tofu

***BONUS TIP***

Iron rich foods, particularly plant-based sources, should be ingested with sources of **Vitamin C**, this increases its absorption. Avoid ingesting iron-rich foods with phytates (bran cereals, bread) or tannins (tea, coffee), these will inhibit iron uptake.

Foods high in Vitamin C:
* Green Leafy Vegetables - Spinach, kale, rucola, lettuce
* Oranges
* Peppers
* Beetroots
* Strawberries
* Brussel Sprouts
* Broccoli

To calculate the [daily iron requirements](https://www.bda.uk.com/resource/iron-rich-foods-iron-deficiency.html) according to your gender and age group, follow the recommendations provided by the British Dietetic Association (BDA); 
  * Males 11-18 years = 11.3mg/day
  * Males 19+ years = 8.7mg/day
  * Females 11-50 years (@premenopause) = 14.8mg/day
  * Females 50+ years (@postmenopause) = 8.7mg/day
