## Swap that -> for THIS! 

Everything comes at a cost, so does food! Apart from a price tag, food comes at a **calorie tag**. Just like Euro/USD/GBP, the monetary unit is in **Calories**. A [Calorie](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/managing-your-weight/understanding-calories/) is a **unit of energy** that a food or drink provides. 

Losing weight is a simple logical mathematical system; 

Calorie **surplus** = weight **gain**
Calorie **deficit** = weight **loss**

Simply **swapping** foods that are costing you too many calories, with something at a lower caloric cost, will automatically **minimise your daily calorie intake**. The overall aim is to **avoid being in a surplus on a daily basis**, preventing weight gain. 

Apart from calories, **sugar** similarly merits a watchful eye, primarily because high sugar consumption leads to an increase in the process called [lipogenesis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/lipogenesis) - this is the pathway by which **excess sugar** in our bodies is turned into and **stored as fat** (adipose tissue/ liver fat). So even in the event of containing equal amounts of calories, if one has less sugar than the other, **opt for the food item containing the least amount**. Excess sugar will be stored as fat and provide only **empty** calories that wonâ€™t keep your satiety happy for long. [WHO](https://www.who.int/news/item/04-03-2015-who-calls-on-countries-to-reduce-sugars-intake-among-adults-and-children#:~:text=A%20new%20WHO%20guideline%20recommends,would%20provide%20additional%20health%20benefits.) recommends keeping your daily sugar consumption to **25gr or less**. 

Here are my **12 recommendations** for healthier food swaps; 

### 1. Crisps -> Homemade Popcorn

### 9. Butter -> Applesauce 
![buttervsapplesauce]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog_images/23_9.webp)

Swap butter in your cake batter with applesauce. As a bonus, applesauce not only comes with fewer calories but also natural sweetnees allowing you to reduce the amount of sugar that needs to be added to your batter. 

| Butter      | Applesauce |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 745kcal/100gr      |   81/kcal/100gr |

### 10. Doughnut -> Protein Bar 
![doughnutvsproteinbar]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog_images/23_10.webp)

| Doughnut    | Protein bar |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 322 kcal/100gr     |  328 kcal/100gr       |
| 20gr sugar/100gr   |   3.4gr sugar/100gr        |

My favourite protein bar is from the Grenade range. It does not only hold the best macro ratio with a whooping 20gr of protein per bar but also tastes great just like a regular chocolate-caramel bar!

### 11. Juices -> Fresh Fruit 
![juicesvsfreshfruit]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog_images/23_11.webp)

| Store-bought fruit juice     | Freshly squeezed fruit juice |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 47 kcal/100ml      |  34 kcal/100ml       |
| 9.2gr sugar/100ml   |   7.9gr sugar/100ml        |

### 12. Chocolate Candy Bar -> 85% Dark Chocolate 
![chocolatecandybarvsdarkchocolate]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/blog_images/23_12.webp)

| Regular chocolate candy bar    | 85% dark chocolate |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 505 kcal/100gr     |  610 kcal/100gr       |
| 44gr sugar/100gr   |   14gr sugar/100gr        |

Although the swap points towards a higher calorie option, bear in mind that you are more likely to consume a whole chocolate candy bar (approx. 60gr) as opposed to dark chocolate, where one is more likely to have a small square, thus still cosuming far fewer calories. Also notice the huge difference in sugar content, with the chocolate candy bar having **3 times as much sugar** when compared to the same amount of dark chocolate.
