## Grocery shopping may feel intimidating for those seeking to change their usual list to a healthier one. Here are a few tips to help you steer your way through the aisles. 

You may well be motivated to change your lifestyle and start eating healthy, but unless you get rid of the crisps and sweets peaking through your pantry, the goal may seem harder to commit to. Wisely choosing what to put in your trolley whilst grocery shopping will be your first step towards changing your eating habits. 

### Here is my list with _ staple foods that should always make it to your trolley. 

1.Fruits & Vegetables 
Choose a variety of vegetables to make sure that half of your plates are always full of vegetables. Opt for vegetables and fruits that are fresh and in season. Be weary of dried fruits, although they do contain nutrients, they are still high in natural sugars, consume only in small quantities. Choose green leafy vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, kale, lettuce, cabbage, rucola, swiss chard, all high in fibre, folate, antioxidants, minerals iron, magnesium and calcium and vitamins C and K. Red and orange vegetables such as carrots, peppers and tomatoes, high in vitamins A, C and K and mineral potassium.
All fruits are ideal, especially when in season, examples include, apples, kiwi, bananas, strawberries and blueberries. For diabetics, opt for low GI fruits such as apples, pears, oranges, grapefruit and berries. 

2. Nuts 
Swap your snacks with nuts. You can opt for nut butters such as hazelnut, peanut and almond butters. When ading nuts to your meals, be consious of your portion. 3 walnuts yield 83kcal, 6 almonds yield 35 kcal, 1 tablespoon peanut butter, 109 kcals. So you might ask, so why eat nuts? 
Nuts, in moderation are excellent sources of antioxidants, anti-inflammatories, fibre, and have shown to aid weightloss, lower 'bad' cholesterol, decrease your risk of heart disease and improve blood sugar levels.

3. Dark Chocolate
The most common perceived barrier to weightloss across clients is the need to for something sweet after dinner. This is completely normal, and you're not the only one experiencing this. Swap your milk chocolate bar (250kcals) with an 70% (or more) dark chocolate square (40kcals) and you'll be saving yourself approx. 200kcals. As a bonus, dark chocolate helps fight sugar cravings, reducing your apetite for more sweetness and is rich in antioxidants, iron and magnesium. 

4. Wholegrain bread, cereals and grains
Do not fear carbs in wholegrains, in the right ammounts, they provide lots of fibre, protein, vitamin B, antioxidants and minerals such  as iron and calcium. For those seeking to increase their folic acid intake, wholegrains are excellent sources. They also have shown to help lower cholesterol, blood pressure and bood sugar levels when looked at as part of a Mediterranean Diet. Always opt for unrefined sources that retained all three layers of the wholegrain; the bran (rich in fibre, Vit.B and minerals) + endosperm + germ. This way you would be taking advantage of all of the benefits that wholegrains have to offer. 
Choose ; Oats, brown rice, quinoa, rye, barley, wholegrain cereals, bread and pasta. 
Keep an eye on the nutrition labels of cereals. Addedd flavours may increase the sugar content. Choose plain oats rather than flavoured oats for instance. 

5. Eggs 
1 egg contains 8g of protein, making eggs an excellent protein source. They can be cooked in many ways and incorporated into salads, omelettes and as binding and coating agents. Apart from protein eggs provide vitamins A, D  and B. 

6. Dairy 
Dairy foods such as milk, yoghurt and cottage cheese contain Vitamin D, calcium, potassium and magnesium - bone builders, ideal for people suffering from osteoporosis and children still in their developmental ages. 
Dairy products such as yoghurts also contain probiotics - ideal for gut health and digestion. 
Be careful not to choose yoghurts with added sugars, always check the label, natural greek yoghurt or skyr are better options with around 10g of protein per 100g.

7. Legumes/ Beans 
Such  as lentils, chickpeas, edamame beans, red kidney beans and peas. Beans and legumes are an ideal source of plant protein for vegans. Chickpeas in particular have shown to improve insulin sensitivity post meals and is high in fibre- making it ideal as a snack - Hummus. Like chickpeas, lentils can also help lower blood sugar but are also good sources of iron. Black and red kidney beans contain folate, important especially during pregnancy, needed for foetal neural development. 

8. Lean Protein 
Last but not least - lean protein. As more research emerges we are continously bomarded to  stay away from saturated fats and processed meats high in salts. For this reason, opt for lean protein such as chicken, turkey, lean cuts of beef. 
Fish is also a very good source of lean protein, especially white fish such  as cod, haddock, grouper, halibut, tilapia, and bass. Since white fish does not have as much omega 3's (good fats) as other darker-fleshed fish such as salmon and tuna, it is a good idea to have a mix of both.
