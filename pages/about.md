I got my first degree at the age of 22 and started working within the health sector as an allied health professional (AHP) at Mater Dei Hospital. Parallel with my growing experience in the health sector, my passion for sport and nutrition also continued to grow whilst pursuing weightlifting as a sport. So in 2019, I applied for a **Masters in Exercise and Nutrition Science** with the University of Chester. My studies were supported by two scholarship awards which I managed to earn through a series of interviews. I successfully completed my Masters degree in 2021 with a Distinction, and graduated as a **Sports Nutritionist**. 

I became a member of the British Dietetic Association and obtained [official registration](https://www.bda.uk.com/senr-sport-and-exercise-nutrition-register/senr-listing/rebecca-micallef-dalli-rebmd-sports-nutrition-san-gwann-malta-0052092.html) on the UK Sports and Exercise Nutrition Register (SENR) as a Graduate. 

These achievements helped me engage in the field of sports nutrition and work as a free lance sports nutritionist, offering my clients not only solutions to their perceived barriers to healthy eating and training, but also the necessary tools to learn about nutritional components of food, enabling them to continue supporting a healthy lifestyle independently. I have always been dedicated towards my training and nutrition, and am a firm believer of setting an example for my clients.
